# 2048

This is a project that I decided to code over the summer after my sophomore year of college.
I thought it would take many moons to figure it out; turns out the game isn't too tremendously complicated.
With JSwing and a weekend of sleep deprivation, my version of 2048 came into existence.

As of Fall 2020, I am in the process of translating it into an Android application.

Hope you enjoy, and please email me (jellybelly4998@gmail.com) a screenshot of the winning screen if you make it to 2048.
